# Lectures on Quantitative Methods for ACJ Students

The links below are to files that were used during the lectures. They have the tables, graphs, and other statistical results, along with all the R programs that were used to create them. These files are displayed during the lectures.

The files do not contain my explanations of these results, and most of what I speak during the class. If you want to know that, you have to come to the class.
